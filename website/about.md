php.js is a resource that offers community-built JavaScript alternatives to PHP functions.

**Why on earth would you port php to js?**

 - to create interoperable server/client-side base64 and URL encoding functions that were lacking when we started
 - to see if we could
 - to learn JavaScript
 - to help others learn JavaScript
 - to profit from a few more useful functions such as:
[strip_tags](http://phpjs.org/functions/strip_tags/),
[strtotime](http://phpjs.org/functions/strtotime/),
[md5](http://phpjs.org/functions/md5/),
[strftime](http://phpjs.org/functions/strftime/),
[number_format](http://phpjs.org/functions/number_format/),
[wordwrap](http://phpjs.org/functions/wordwrap/), 
[vsprintf](http://phpjs.org/functions/vsprintf/), and
[date](http://phpjs.org/functions/date/), that are too high-level for JavaScript.

PHP is a language with a huge standard library that a large share of web developers
are intimately familiar with.

JavaScript as a language is even more wide-spread, but lacking a similar large 
standard library, developers coming from other languages are often wondering how
to achieve common tasks, like [formatting dates](http://phpjs.org/functions/strftime/), 
or [generating a hashes](http://phpjs.org/functions/sha1/).

php.js aims to show developers coming from the PHP world how to achieve these things
in JavaScript. We had to write a lot of it in order to port {{ site.functions |size }} functions. We appreciate the language and hope you will too. php.js exists to aid in learning it, not to avoid that.

One thing you'll notice is that we're also porting low-level PHP functions like
[strpos](http://phpjs.org/functions/strpos/)
that have perfectly good (and more performant) JavaScript equivalents right in its standard library by means of e.g.  [String.indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf).

There are two reasons why we went the extra mile:

1. To show newcomers by example how the behavior differs across languages (`false` vs `-1` in the example of `strpos` vs `indexOf`)
2. The geeky-challenge of porting ALL-THE-THINGS also suddenly opens up php.js to other fun experiments such as running actual `.php` files on V8. While we would advice against using that for anything serious, we sure think it's fun to see if we can manage (this does pose the burden of mimicking PHP as good as we can, even its mistakes).

Something we discovered was that php.js won't be able to fully support PHP arrays on all platforms because some platforms do not preserve ordering in objects. Rightfully, because it's not part of ECMA. Instead of rolling our own data-structures, this is a case where we accept defeat. We take comfort in the fact that most platforms preserve ordering, and there are rumors of it becoming a part of ECMA.

Going by [The McDonald's Theory](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d) 
we have plenty of functions online that aren't perfect just yet.
